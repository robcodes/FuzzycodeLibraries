# Fuzzycode Libraries

Shared libraries and tooling used across the Fuzzycode platform.

## Libraries
- `touchpad-controls/`: Touchpad controls runtime, LLM pipeline, prompts, and regression tests.

## Structure
- Each library lives in its own folder with a dedicated README, docs, and tooling.
- Cross-library conventions (prompts, docs, tests) are kept lightweight and local.
